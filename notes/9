Pre-fetching could be done in software

Associative mapping cache:
- any memory could be placed anywhere

Direct mapping cache:
- The actual memory location maps to a specific location to  cache

N-Way set associative:
- a cache line from a particular block of memory can appear ina a limited number 
  of places in cache. each limited place is a set
- a set contains n sets
- any data could be placed anywhere
- memory blcok appears anywhere in cache line of its set

Mapping looks like this:
- memory address division 64 -> which line block of memory -> modulos 4 -> cache set #
- memory address modulos 64  -> offset in cache line
- => both of these tell us where to find certain memory address in the cache
___

Cache can interact with cores in unexpected ways
- each core makes a copy of the cache
- in multi  core processing the cache will no longer mtach on returning from fork

- MESI L2 to the rescue:
- Modified
- Exlusive
- Shared
- Invalid
