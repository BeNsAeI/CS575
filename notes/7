OMP Critical directive:
- Like atomic
- One thread at the time runs the code (Similar to mutex(

OMP Single:
- Restricts execution to only one thread
- it happens only once by one of the threads

OMP Barrier:
- Force each thread to wait here until all threads arrive

OMP parallel Sections:
- omp section (for each task)
- there is an implied barrier for each section
- a section is basically a thread
- each thread tacles a section

omp task:
- Basically also a thread
- Look at the notes

omp taskwait
- 

Tasks:
- also basically a thread
- Processing each element of a linked list
- Tree traversal Algorithms
- off load it to a thread
