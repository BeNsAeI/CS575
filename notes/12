Distribution design pattern for parallelism

- thread to thread: threads communicate to one another
- Broadcast: master sends al lof the data to all threads
- Reduction: all threads compute and send to master to get summed
- scatter: master sends pieces of data to each thread
- gather: pieces of data computed by threads get put toether in master
