Trapezoid approximation
- Don't use simple addition, you get a racing condition
- use reducggtion(+:sum) instead

SpeedUp: ratio of time spent on a single thread vs multiple threads
         - how much faster are we processing each thread
Amdahl's law:
 - T1 / Tn = 1 / (F_{par}/n + F_{seq})
 - F_{par} could be parallelized
 - F_{seq} could not be parallelized
 - f_{seq} = 1 - F_{par}
 - As the time for parallel portion goes to 0, but the sequential part does not change
 - At some point adding threads comes at deminition returns

Gustafson's observation:
 - We can attack problems with significantly larger datasets
 - S = (1- F_{par}) / F_{par}
 - multiply F_{par} by N
 - the larger the N, the higher the speed up
 - It pays off to have very large datasets

- We can take the speed up that we want and use it to get the parallel fraction:
 - 100 = T1/Tn = 1 / (F_{par}/n + F_{seq})
 - F_{par} = (n/(n-1))*(1-(1/speedup))
