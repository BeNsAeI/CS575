MESI is there to let OS know that there are several copies
- Content of cache line does no longer match memory

Combat false sharing #1:
 - Put padding
 - We are trying to put them on different cache lines

Combat false sharing #2:
 - each trhead gets its own stack
 - store values in local temporary variables in each thread
 - float tmp = array[i].value

Mallocing in a cache line:
 - struct hack *p = (struct hack *) malloc (ARRAYSIZE) * sizeof(struct hack));
 - struct hack *Array = &p[0];
 - ...
 - Array[i].x = 10;
- VS
 - unsigned char * p = (unsigned char *) malloc (64+(ARRAYSIZE)* sizeof(struct hack));
 - int offset = (long int) p & 0x3f;
 - struct hack * Array = (struct hack *) &p[64-offset];
