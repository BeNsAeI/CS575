Pragma OMP Task if(condition)
- this if feature of omp
- if condition is true:
 - spawn off a thread to do this code
- otherwise:
 - Do it yourself, no more threads

Pragma OMP Task if(Cond) tied/untide
- This task is assigned(tied) to only one thread
- tied -> forces no other thread helping other trhfeads when they are done
- untied -> allows a task to be run on other threads

Project #2:
N-Body symulation
- N number of particles
- Each point exerts a gravitational force
- predict the behavior of all points
- Complexity of the problem is N^2
- the program is given and is sequential
- prallelize it
- reduction sums are needed
- parallelize either the i loop or the j loop
- compare course grain and fine grain
- compare types of scheduling
 - Static allocation of work (it is tied)
 - dynamic allocation of work (it is not tied)

Cache Architecture
- memory is much slower than CPUs
- Caching came about to solve this issue
- it makes the memory higher arctival

Memory pyramids:
- Registers
- Cache (L1, L2, L3)
- RAM
- Storage
- Optical drives

Cache:
- Cache is a fixed amount of emmory L1 -> 64 kilobytes long (depending on the architecture)
- Cache hits and misses
- in cache going through rows and columns cases huge tyme complexity changes
- structs are continuous pieces of memories
- struct example:
 - X,Y,Z vs X[],Y[] and Z[]
