   So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all people, for the
earth is filled with some wicked s**t because of them! I am surely
going to destroy both them and the earth because ... it's more dramatic that way! 

   Go build an arc and take a pair of each animal (don't forget the Dodo
They look liek birds, but they can't fly ... I guess chickens too).

  - "But god Jesus was good at carpenting, not me " said Noah to God
  - Not with the whole "ow your son this and that" again replied God
    Just build a canoe or a small fishing boat would do, I'll shrink everything!

So Noah built the boat, but God got busy with planning his next religion
and forgot to shrink the animals.
Noah decided to teach God a lesson, and only brought some grain,
6 Deers and 2 Wolves to his boat.
